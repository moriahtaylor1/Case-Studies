# Case-Studies
Some final reports from my senior-level case studies course (STA440 at Duke University)

## Case Study 2 - World Happiness
Focuses on creating compelling visualizations in Tableau using data from the World Happiness Report. This was a group assignment.

## Final Case Study
The final case study was an individual assignment. We were allowed to pick any type of data to use. I chose to scrape information about 
NBA basketball players. 

My report focuses on the metric of NBA efficiency which is a statistic calculated by summing all positive stats (points, rebounds, assists, 
steals, block shots) and subtracting all negative stats (turnovers, missed shots). For fun, I conducted a simple hypothesis test to see if 
Lebron James was significantly more effective than other players in the league (spoiler alert: he is). Then, the big question I chose to 
explore was whether or not the one-and-done rule affected the efficiency of rookie players in the league (the thought process being that 
younger players may be less efficient).

My Tableau dashboard contains 3 different visualizations:
    1) Line Chart: NBA stats throughout the years
    2) Scatterplot: Height and Weight of Players in each Position
    3) Histogram: Comparing stats of UNC players and Duke players in the NBA
